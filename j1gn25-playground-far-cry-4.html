A second grader cornered me on the playground and shoved me off the swing because he wanted a turn. My palms skinned, knees dirty, I climbed to my feet, tears in my eyes and fists clenched in sorrow and rage. And there he sat, on my swing. Laughing. That’s when I felt it. A tightness in my throat, a lump that threatened to choke me, a writhing in my belly. I heaved, and instead of lunch coming up, a small little snake Осторожно! Спойлер!

I don’t think I can put into words, how good it feels being a Father. I love Daniel more than I could possibly say. His bright, shining smile, his endless curiosity about the world around him, and his gentle, loving nature. I didn’t think I was capable of loving someone else this much, but every time I heard his little laugh, or saw his smile, I knew. Even the smallest things he did made me so incredibly proud. Every achievement he earned was something I wanted to celebrate. Even the interes. #There's been an update: gtgtEdit: Guess who was wrong on the internet. gtgtAs many others have pointed out this post is mostly inaccurate. gtgtAfter some googling it turns out that what /u/Dovahkiin419 is talking about is a theory called Color wheel theory of love (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel_theory_of_love) which was invented by a Canadian psychologist in the 70's.

POTM Hazard had been doing that job for over 800 games (~600 goals and 350 assists) but with defenders getting bigger and better by the day, his finishing was iffy and his size a liability. I didn't do Raul sbc because I didn't like his loan card and had it languishing in my club with about 17 games left on it, but I decided to give him a second chance like Dumbledore. He was brilliant this time round. Regrettably Утилита устраняет ошибку "черного экрана" при запуске Far Cry 4. Для 2-х ядерных процессоров (без технологии Hyper-Threading) и для 3-х ядерных процессоров. First time poster here. This happened this past summer. We live in a HCOL area. Lots of wealthy/entitled people. We are not poor, but (very) far from wealthy. The wife and I take our kids to the local public park. Now, this park is awesome and FREE. It has a huge splash park, three playgrounds, tennis courts, paved nature trails, etc. The final cool feature it has, is a full sized carousel. This is the only thing that costs anything, besides stuff at the concession stand. It’s As a child, I lived in a small town with an even smaller circle of friends. A circle of friends that needed something to do, in a town with nothing. We were the type of kids that would run through abandoned buildings or start rumors of the creepy house on the block. Unfortunately, none of those opportunities were presented to us. So when we were told to 'go play outside', we had to be creative with it. Which wasn't too challenging, we were kids after all. We'd make up any number of fantasies. Играю в far cry 4 прошел половину, только-что прошел пролог far cry 3 (я ее уже 20 раз проходил). 
So, this happened years ago when I was round about 13/14 in high school. I was pretty chubby and I had thick glasses (which I still have). I was the good kid and I never spoke out. I also cried in class a lot. I was a true bullying target. Though nobody ever did for pretty sad reasons, my mother passed away from cancer when I was quite young. Everyone knew about my past, they understood and never brought up mum jokes around me. Until there was this one kid. Let’s name this kid D for douchebag.

A large group of other students had decided my friends and I were lesbians for some reason, and were making our lives hell. It started out as verbal harassment and the like, but it quickly escalated to physical abuse. We tried going to the playground aides, but they never did anything. There were three of them, as the playground was split into three parts. There was a jungle gym, a basketball court, and a large field. Оценки Famitsu за эту неделю: Devil May Cry 5 получила.

When ever i take him to the vet to get his shots the vet struggles to vaccinate him because he purrs, licks and smooges them wanting affection. Leo isn’t a service cat but i do have high anxiety and generally take him every where with me when i’m going on a quick trip to the shops or a walk (he’s strictly an indoor cat) i transport him around in a pram and put his carrier in the pram so he doesn’t jump out.

In the late 90’s I worked as a school librarian. It was at an Elementary school in Bibb county GA and I had taught English there for three years before I was moved to the library. Until recently the job had just been a volunteer position usually taken by retired educators until it started becoming difficult to find any takers. That’s when the principal asked me to take it over and when he offered to pay the same salary. Length warning. TLDR; My Dad got into drugs and left when I was 10. I'm now 25 and he's done nothing but continuously break the law, spend time in jail, wrack up unpaid child support, wrack up court fees, tried new and more drugs, and I can't see myself ever speaking to him again. Someone else's story got me thinking about this and while typing a response to them it became a book, so I figured this would best make its own post.
